                RUNNING THE RASP TOOLS / PROBABILISTIC PARSER

The shell script rasp.sh invokes the sentence boundary detector -
tokeniser - tagger - morphological analyser - parser on raw text. The
script rasp_parse.sh invokes just the probabilistic parser on text that
has already been processed by the previous stages.

BEFORE trying to run either script for the first time, edit them to
insert the appropriate value for the shell variable RASP, which should
be the file system pathname where you have installed the RASP tools.

rasp.sh
-------

rasp.sh [-m] [-p parser-options]

The command operates as a filter, reading from the standard input and
writing to the standard output.

Command-line options are:

  -m Analyse with multiple tags per word (so that mistaggings are
     less likely).

  -p Pass the immediately following string as options to the parser (see
     below for parser options).

Examples of running the command are:

  ./rasp.sh -m < file.txt > analysed.txt

  echo "This is a test." | ./rasp.sh -p'-os -u'

Additional ways of modifying the behaviour of the system are via the
shell environment variables

  rasp_sentence
  rasp_tokenise
  rasp_tag
  rasp_morph
  rasp_parse

One or more of these can be set (in the unix shell environment) to a
different command that RASP should use instead of the normal one, e.g.
(in a Bourne-like shell)

  echo "^ He helps." | rasp_sentence=cat rasp_morph=cat rasp_parse=cat ./rasp.sh

would use the system command "cat" instead of the sentence boundary
detector, morphological analyser and parser. This might be useful if the
text was already marked up with sentence boundary markers, and the user
did not want either the morphological analyser or parser to be run.


rasp_parse.sh
-------------

rasp_parse.sh [-e] [-i <initforms>] [-l <logfile>] [-n <nparses>]
              [-o <outformat>] [-s] [-t <timeout>] [-u]
              [-w <wordlimit>] [-x]

The command operates as a filter, reading from the standard input and
writing to the standard output.

Command-line options are:

 
  -e Output analyses in a form suitable for input to the PARSEVAL
     or greval programs.

  -i Pass Lisp forms to be evaluated before parsing any sentences.

  -l Specify a filename for the output of logging information. By
     default, diagnostic information is output to a file called
     /tmp/<username>-rasp_parse.sh-log; this option should be used if
     a single user is running more than one parser process
     simultaneously, otherwise the log files will overwrite each
     other.

  -n Give the maximum number of parses that should be produced for
     each sentence. The default is 1; a value of zero indicates all
     parses.

  -o Specify the form of output from the parser. Possible values are:

     a   trees labelled with grammr aliases
     g   grammatical relations (the default);
     i 	 grammatical relations weighted using a variant of the
         	inside-outside algorithm 
     w   weighted grammatical relations computed from the top n trees
         	(only useful if the number of parses option -n is set to >1)  
     s   shallow phrasal-level trees (sparkle format);
     z   shallow phrasal-level trees (susanne format);
     t   trees labelled with grammar rule names;
     u   UPenn treebank style trees (but NOT following the treebank
         annotation guidelines and using different node labels).
     p   print ALL of the above formats

  -s Turn on the use of verb subcategorisation frame probabilities;
     there is built-in information for around 500 verbs.

  -t Set a CPU time limit (in seconds) for the processing of each
     sentence (default 20).

  -u Turn off the numbering of words in sentences.

  -w Give the maximum number of words in a sentence that the parser
     should attempt to process.

  -x Turn off the use of a list of phrasal verbs that normally allows
     more accurate identification of verb-particle constructions.

The input should be part-of-speech tagged text, in one of two
alternative formats. The first format is where each word has a single
tag, prefixed by underscore "_", and each sentence is preceded by ^_^
and is on a separate line, e.g.

  ^_^ Yesterday_RT Swapo_NP1 register+ed_VVD its_APP$ opposition_NN1 

The tagset assumed is CLAWS2 (see
<http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/research/ucrel/claws2tags.html>),
and sentence boundaries and tokenisation should be as done by the
supplied modules. Words should be lemmatised, as above, if the parser is
to use its phrasal verb or subcategorisation information.

The second input format allows a single word to have several possible
part-of-speech labels (each with a probability), to mitigate the
effects of incorrect tag assignment. The parser then choses the most
likely tag given the global structure of the sentence. Each word
should be on a separate line, and each sentence prefixed with "^",
for instance:

  ^ ^_^:1 
  Yesterday Yesterday_RT:1 
  Swapo Swapo_NP1:1 
  registered registered_JJ:0.00203291 register+ed_VVD:0.966428 
  its its_APP$:1 
  opposition opposition_NNJ1:0.201115 opposition_NN1:0.798885 

Thus, each line is <wordform> [<lemmatised-word>_<tag>:<probability>]+.
The parser has a full treatment of quotation in the cases where it
is balanced -- assumed to be when there is an even number of quotation
marks in the sentence. If there is an odd number then all quotation
marks are ignored.

Examples of usage of rasp_parse.sh:

  ./rasp_parse.sh -l/tmp/log1 -s -t5 < tagged.txt

  ./rasp_parse.sh -n1000 -ogw <<EOF
  ^_^ Yesterday_RT Swapo_NP1 register+ed_VVD its_APP$ opposition_NN1
  EOF

In more advanced use (see `Tuning' in $RASP/manuals/tsg-doc.pdf) the
parameter +disabled-rules+ can be edited in rasp_parse.sh to control
the use of marked rules in the grammar: eg (defparameter
+disabled-rules+ nil) allows use of rules for elliptical,
dialogue-like language to be evoked which are by default disabled.
