	CLAWS2 TAGLIST

	(The second column of tags, containing an asterisk, are known
	as 'cover tags', and are used in the development of automatic
	parsing techniques.  They are not relevant to the task of
	post-editing.  They are include for interest because they do
	occur in some types of CLAWS2 output)

	NOTE: "DITTO TAGS"

	Any of the tags listed above may in theory be modified by the 
	addition of a pair of numbers to it: eg. DD21, DD22.
	This signifies that the tag occurs as part of a sequence of similar
	tags, representing a sequence of words which for grammatical purposes
	are treated as a single unit. For example the expression "in terms of"
	is treated as a single preposition, receiving the tags:
 
			 in_II31 terms_II32 of_II33 

	The first of the two digits indicates the number of words/tags
	in the sequence, and the second digit the position of each
	word within that sequence.

	Such "ditto tags" are not included in the lexicon, but are
	assigned automatically by a program called "IDIOMTAG" which
	looks for a range of multi-word sequences included in the
	"idiomlist".  The following sample entries from the idiomlist
	show that syntactic ambiguity is taken into account, and also
	that, depending on the context, ditto-tags may or may not be
	required for a particular word sequence:

			at_RR21 length_RR22
			a_DD21/RR21 lot_DD22/RR22
			in_CS21/II that_CS22/DD1
