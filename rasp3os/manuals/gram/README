                      DOCUMENTATION FOR GRAMMAR


The documentation is in LaTeX format. To print it out, execute the latex
command on the file 'trep.tex' twice. Then convert the resulting dvi file to
postscript with dvips (note that dvitops will not give correct results), i.e.

   dvips trep.dvi > trep.ps

and send the postscript (in 'trep.ps') to a postscript printer. This
directory already contains a postscript version of the documentation in
'trep.ps' which is ready for printing.

The documentation is 320 pages in length, 162 of which is taken up by a
listing of the grammar (in appendix 3). To omit this appendix, remove
the line

   \input{trep9.append3}

from 'trep.tex' before invoking LaTeX.
