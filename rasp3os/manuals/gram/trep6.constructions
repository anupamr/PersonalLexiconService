\section{Constructions}

\subsection{Passive}

The grammar includes a passive metarule which takes as input
active VP rules and produces as output passive versions of these. This
treatment closely parallels the GPSG85 analysis of passive. The
metarule is restricted in various ways so that it only matches ID
rules which ought to have a passive version. The output rules lose
their N2 object but contain an optional P2[by] instead. \nextex{} and
\exnum{+2}{} are examples of input and output.

A second metarule, PASSIVE2 generates passive versions of some object
raising rules. This metarule has to be separate from the basic passive
metarule because ordinary passive outputs are specified as [AGR
N2[NFORM NORM]] but the passives of object raising rules must be [AGR
@] in order to allow all the different subjects in \nextex{} and
\exnum{+2}{} which are generated by ID rules VP/OR\_INF(PASSIVE2) and
VP/OR\_AP(PASSIVE2) respectively.

\begin{ex}
\begin{subex}
Fido is believed to be a dog (by Lee)
\end{subex}
\begin{subex}
It is believed to bother Lee that fido is a dog
\end{subex}
\begin{subex}
There are believed to be dogs in the garden
\end{subex}
\begin{subex}
That he fell is believed to bother Lee
\end{subex}
\begin{subex}
(For us) to go is believed to be possible
\end{subex}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
\begin{subex}
Fido is considered likely to be a dog (by Lee)
\end{subex}
\begin{subex}
It is considered likely to bother Lee that fido is a dog
\end{subex}
\begin{subex}
There are considered likely to be dogs in the garden
\end{subex}
\begin{subex}
That he fell is considered likely to bother Lee
\end{subex}
\begin{subex}
(For us) to go is considered likely to be possible
\end{subex}
\end{ex}

There are a further set of passive VP rules which exist as basic ID
rules instead of being generated by the passive metarules. These ID
rules account for various `odd' passives: for example, `prepositional
passives' \nextex{}, ones where the sentential complement is promoted
to subject position \exnum{+2}{}, and ones which are passive versions
of extraposed actives \exnum{+3}{}.

\begin{ex}
We are being looked at (by everyone) \hspace{5mm} (VP/PP/PASS)
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
That fido is a dog is believed (by Lee) \hspace{5mm} (VP/SFIN/PASS)
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
 Kim is bothered that Lee likes reading books \hspace{5mm} (VP/NP\_SFIN2B/PASS)
\end{ex}

The semantics of passive VPs are just like the semantics of actives
except that the subject of a passive VP is realised not as the first
non-event argument of the verb but as the second. When the P2[by] is
present its N2 complement is realised as the first non-event argument.
The fact that a P2[by] is non-predicative means that it has a
semantics which keeps the translation of the preposition separate from
the translation of its N2 complement. The translations in passive
rules utilise the N2 meaning but discard the preposition ({\tt (2
(lambda (by) (lambda (np) np))}). When the optional P2[by] is absent,
the semantics supplies an existentially quantified agent
interpretation: {\tt (uq (some (x1) (entity x1)))}. Passives with a
P2[by] have the same semantic representation as the corresponding
active \nextex{} and passives without the P2[by] have the same
semantic representation modulo the agent argument \exnum{+2}{}.

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim helped the abbot"
"the abbot was helped by kim"

(DECL
 (HELP (uqe (some (e1) (PAST e1)))
       (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
       (dd (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (ABBOT x2))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"the abbot was helped"

(DECL
 (HELP (uqe (some (e1) (PAST e1))) 
       (uq (some (x1) (entity x1)))
       (dd (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (ABBOT x2))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

In the semantic translation of those prepositional verbs which can
form prepositional passives (ones specified as [SUBTYPE PVERB]) the
preposition introducing the object N2 is incorporated into a complex
predicate with the verb in both the active and the passive:

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"she slept in the bed"
(DECL
 ((CP SLEEP IN) (uqe (some (e1) (PAST e1)))
                (pro (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (female x1))))
                (dd (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (BED x2))))))

"the bed has been slept in"
(DECL
 ((CP SLEEP IN) (uqe (some (e1) (PRES (PERF e1)))) 
                (uq (some (x1) (entity x1)))
                (dd (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (BED x2))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

\subsection{Subject-Auxiliary Inversion}

Following GPSG85 we handle subject-auxiliary inversion by means of 
metarules. There are two metarules for this: SAI and ELL/SAI. In this
section we restrict our attention to SAI. The motivation behind
ELL/SAI can be found in section 6.7.

The SAI metarule \nextex{} takes the rules for auxiliaries and modals
(VP/MODAL1a--VP/BE\_CLEFT3) as input.  The metarule outputs rules for
generating inverted Ss headed by [AUX +] verbs. These S rules are just
like the VP inputs except the mother node is an S, the auxiliary is
[FIN +], and there is an extra N2[CASE NOM] daughter.

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
SAI : ; Subject Auxiliary Inversion metarule. Applies to all
      ; non-[ELLIP +] auxiliary rules except for VP/TO. The 
      ; listing of possible input SUBCAT values excludes VP/TO. 
      ; SLASH propagation is done here too.

   H[+INV], X2[SLASH @s], N2[+NOM, -PRD, SLASH NOSLASH], W :
   1 = [~PAST, NEG -], 5 = [PAST -, NEG -],
      (lambda (s) (s (lambda (prop) (lambda (ta)
        (lambda (equa) (lambda (Q) (Q (lambda (e) (prop e 3))
          (lambda (e2) (PRES (ta e2))) equa))))))) :
   1 = [~PAST, NEG +], 5 = [PAST -, NEG +],
      (lambda (s) (s (lambda (prop) (lambda (ta)
        (lambda (equa) (lambda (Q) (Q (lambda (e) (prop e 3))
          (lambda (e2) (PRES (ta e2))) equa))))))) :
   1 = [~PAST, NEG -], 5 = [PAST +, NEG -],
      (lambda (s) (s (lambda (prop) (lambda (ta)
        (lambda (equa) (lambda (Q) (Q (lambda (e) (prop e 3))
          (lambda (e2) (PAST (ta e2))) equa))))))) :
   1 = [~PAST, NEG +], 5 = [PAST +, NEG +],
      (lambda (s) (s (lambda (prop) (lambda (ta)
        (lambda (equa) (lambda (Q) (Q (lambda (e) (prop e 3))
          (lambda (e2) (PAST (ta e2))) equa))))))) :
   1 = [PAST FUT, NEG -], 5 = [PAST FUT, NEG -],
      (lambda (s) (s (lambda (prop) (lambda (ta) 
        (lambda (equa) (lambda (Q) (Q (lambda (e) (prop e 3))
          (lambda (e2) (FUT (ta e2))) equa))))))) :
   1 = [PAST FUT, NEG +], 5 = [PAST FUT, NEG +],
      (lambda (s) (s (lambda (prop) (lambda (ta) 
        (lambda (equa) (lambda (Q) (Q (lambda (e) (prop e 3))
          (lambda (e2) (FUT (ta e2))) equa))))))).
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

The trees in \nextex{} and \exnum{+2}{} indicate the structure
associated with one of the input rules, VP/HAVE, and the structure
associated with the output, VP/HAVE(SAI).

The SAI metarule is restricted such that only NP subjects can be
inverted and not S subjects (*{\it does that Lee reads the book bother
Kim}). Inverted sentences occurring on their own are recognised as
yes-no questions. They also occur as the S which is sister to a
preposed wh-constituent (wh-questions, e.g. {\it which book did Kim
read}).

In terms of semantics, the SAI metarule takes the input VP semantics
and applies it to the meaning of the N2 subject and an appropriate
tense operator, depending on the instantiation of the feature PAST.
Apart from VP/WILL, the rules which are input do not have conditions
associated with PAST so the first four clauses of the semantic part of
the metarule apply to these (i.e.\ the clauses 
marked \verb+1 = [~PAST,..]+).
These clauses ensure that on the output rules the semantics will be
conditional on whether the auxiliary is [PAST --] or [PAST +] and on
whether it is [NEG --] (e.g.\ {\it can}) or [NEG +] (e.g.\ {\it
can't}). The fifth and sixth clauses are for VP/WILL which is marked
as [PAST FUT] and its output is [PAST FUT] too. To illustrate we show
the rule VP/HAVE and the linearised output VP/HAVE(SAI).

The translations here are too complex to be easily grasped but the
important thing to notice is that while the VP input rule has four
conditions depending on how SLASH and NEG are instantiated, the output
S rule has eight conditions, again depending on SLASH and NEG, but
also depending on whether the verb is [PAST +] or [PAST --].  This is
in accordance with our treatment of S and VP: tense information is
incorporated at the S level but not at the VP level.

The translations associated with the mother nodes in \exnum{-3}{} and

\subsection{Extraposition}

GPSG85 treats extraposition by means of metarule, but we have chosen
to deal with it by means of directly written basic ID rules, partly
because of the small number of potential input and output rules and
partly because there are a number of odd cases of extraposition not
covered by the GPSG85 metarule.  Extraposition verbs and adjectives
occur with a number of different SUBCAT values but they are all
specified as [SUBTYTPE EXTRAP]. The grammar deals with the following
kinds of example:

\begin{tabular}[t]{llll}
\addtocounter{examplectr}{1}
(\arabic{examplectr}) &
      a   & That he left matters \hspace{3.5cm} & ID rule VP/SFIN3A \\
\ \ & \ \ & It matters that he left           & ID rule VP/SFIN3B \\

\ \ & h   & It is not clear to us whether he left & ID rule A1/PP\_WHSA \\
\ \ & \ \ & Whether he left is not clear to us    & ID rule A1/PP\_WHSB \\
\end{tabular}
     
In the semantics, the proposition represented by the extraposable V2
complement occurs as an argument of the verb or adjective, such that
extraposed/non-extraposed pairs have the same representation:

\begin{verbatim}
"that the abbey is falling down doesn't matter"
"it doesn't matter that the abbey is falling down"

\subsection{Unbounded Dependencies}

\subsubsection{Unbounded Dependency Syntax}

Following GPSG85, our treatment of unbounded dependencies involves the
use of the category-valued feature SLASH. If a constituent is preposed
from its normal position, SLASH is propagated through the tree and
links the preposed constituent with the `gap' (or `trace') that
appears in its normal position. By this means, categorial identity
between the preposed constituent and the gap can be maintained.  Our
treatment achieves much the same kind of results in terms of tree
structures and distribution of gaps as the GPSG85 analysis but our
method of ensuring the propagation of SLASH through trees is somewhat
different.

Before describing SLASH propagation mechanisms in more detail, we
demonstrate in \nextex{} a typical example of SLASH distribution in a
topicalised sentence:

A somewhat simplified description of the way in which SLASH propagates
is as follows: in all non-lexical ID rules SLASH passes from a mother
to a head (e.g.\ the rules for building the embedded S local trees in
\prevex{}). In lexical ID rules (e.g.\ the rules responsible for the
two VPs in \prevex{}) the lexical head cannot be specified with SLASH
so it passes to a non-head. This has two consequences: firstly, the
only categories which can introduce `gaps' ([NULL~+] categories) will be
ones in argument positions (sisters to a lexical head).  Secondly, it
makes it possible to achieve the effects of some island constraints --
for example, the Complex Noun Phrase Constraint which, amongst other
things, prevents extractions out of relative clauses. There are
further complexities involved in the GPSG85 account such as a
treatment of double extractions in parasitic gap constructions but
these are largely irrelevant here, although it should be noted that
our grammar does not extend to an analysis of parasitic gaps.

In GPSG85 the distribution of SLASH in local trees is not generally
controlled by specifications in ID rules but instead is controlled by
well-formedness conditions on local trees: SLASH can be instantiated
on any category in any tree so long as its presence (and its value)
are consistent with the various principles of the theory, in
particular the Head Feature Convention, the Foot Feature Principle and
Feature Cooccurrence Restrictions. In our system all information about
the well-formedness of trees has to reside in the expanded rules which
generate them: we do not use principles to discriminate between well-
and ill-formed local trees. As a consequence of this, we have to
control the distribution of SLASH in very specific terms in the
expanded rules.

In previous versions of our grammar (releases 1 and 2), the categories
in ID rules were not usually specified for the feature SLASH and on
their own they could not describe any long-distance dependencies---a
large number of SLASH metarules were needed for this. If one thinks of
the ID rules as being basic, `unslashed' rules, then the SLASH
metarules defined derived `slashed' versions of the relevant rules.
The derived rules were identical to basic rules except that the
feature SLASH would appear on the mother and on one daughter with the
same variable value. For example, the feature SLASH did not appear in
the rule VP/NP ({\tt VP --$>$ V N2}) and this rule could therefore not
participate in a parse of a sentence containing a preposed direct
object such as {\it sandwiches, Sandy likes E}. In order to parse such a
sentence, a derived rule which introduced SLASH onto the mother and
onto the
N2 object was needed; a metarule generated this new rule on the basis
of the old.  This approach is very much akin to early GPSG treatments
as described in Gazdar et al.\ (1982) and the major disadvantage to it
is the very large increase in the number of rules that it causes.

A more parsimonious approach to long-distance dependencies which has
been discussed in the more recent computational linguistics literature
is that of `gap-threading' (e.g. Periera \& Shieber, 1987). Here,
SLASH must be replaced with two (or more) similar features which
appear as a matter of course on all (or most) categories in rules. The
distinction between basic `unslashed' rules and derived `slashed'
rules disappears since one and the same rule can be used for both
cases. A more complex pattern of variable bindings ensures that
information about the gap propagates up through the tree to link up
with the preposed constituent. A gap-threading approach is easily
implementable in the GDE but for reasons relating to the creation of
LR parse tables (Briscoe \& Carroll, 1991, 1992, Carroll \& Briscoe,
1992), it was decided not to adopt it for the large scale grammar.
Instead a compromise between the two approaches has been adopted.

In this version of the grammar (and in the release 3 version), all
non-lexical major categories are specified for the feature SLASH.  A
series of propagation rules, PSLASH1--PSLASH10 ensure that the value
for SLASH on the mother category of an ID rule is bound to the value
of SLASH on just one of the daughters in the rule. In non-lexical ID
rules, this daughter will be the [BAR 1] or [BAR 2] head. In lexical
ID rules which introduce just one complement daughter apart from the
lexical head, the complement daughter's SLASH feature is bound to the
mother. In lexical ID rules which introduce more than one complement
daughter, just one of these daughters will be bound to the mother.
\nextex{} contains some examples:

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
VP/NP :          VP[SLASH @x] --> V, N2[SLASH @x]
VP/PPa :         VP[SLASH @x] --> V, P2[SLASH @x]
VP/NP_PHRA :     VP[SLASH @x] --> V, N2[SLASH @x], Prt.

VP/OE_INF1 :     VP[SLASH @x] --> V, N2[SLASH @x], VP[SLASH NOSLASH].
VP/OE_AP :       VP[SLASH @x] --> V, N2[SLASH @x], A2[SLASH NOSLASH].
VP/PP_SFIN1a :   VP[SLASH @x] --> V, P2[SLASH @x], S[SLASH NOSLASH].
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

The specification [SLASH NOSLASH] is in fact an alias for [SLASH
[NOSLASH +]] and this provides a suitable category as a value for
SLASH on constituents which do not contain a gap. In all the cases in
\prevex{} the rules are able to generate normal `non-gappy'
constituents where the {\tt @x} is simple instantiated to [SLASH
NOSLASH]. For the first group, these rules are also all that is needed
for generating `gappy' versions as well: if the complement daughter
either contains a gap or is a gap then its value for SLASH will be
instantiated to a [BAR 2] category and this will propagate up to the
mother. The rules in the second group generate only a subset of
possible `gappy' examples. For example, the version of VP/OE\_INF1
above will generate the sentence {\it Kim, Lee persuaded E to leave}
where the N2 object of the verb is preposed. It does not, however, propagate
SLASH between the VP complement and the mother as would be needed in
{\it Kim, Lee persuaded Sandy to help E}. The specification [SLASH
NOSLASH] on the second daughters in the second group of rules is
provided by the set of default rules DSLASH1--DSLASH12. 

In order to generate the second possibility, a new derived rule has to
be created by means of metarules (see metarules MSLASH1a--MSLASH5b).
The derived rule is one where SLASH on the mother is specified as
having to be a [BAR 2] value (the alias X2) as is SLASH on the second
daughter. The values for features on these X2 values are bound between
mother and second daughter. The derived version of VP/OE\_INF1 is:

This method of only generating derived rules where more than one
propagation path through a rule is possible has led to considerable
reductions in grammar size.  The compiled version of the release 2
grammar had approximately 1,500 object grammar rules. The compiled
version of this grammar has 782 object grammar rules.

The SLASH specifications for the top and bottom parts of an unbounded
dependency have to be specifically catered for. The ID rules
S/NP\_UDC1--S/AP\_UDC2 describe the top of the dependency where a
preposed N2, P2 or A2 precedes an S whose SLASH value is the same as
the preposed constituent. We introduce gaps at the bottom of the
dependency by means of the ID rules TRACE1--TRACE8 which allow N2s,
P2s and A2s which are specified with a SLASH value of the same
category as themselves to be realised as a gap. That is, N2[SLASH N2],
A2[SLASH A2] and P2[SLASH P2] can be gaps. The rule in \nextex{} is
the one for N2[SLASH N2].

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
TRACE1 : ; an NP gap
   N2[+SPEC, -ADV, SLASH N2[NFORM NORM, -ADV, PLU @pl, COUNT @co,
            PER @pe, CASE @ca, PRD @pr], NFORM NORM, PLU @pl,
      COUNT @co, PER @pe, CASE @ca, PRD @pr, BEGAP +] -->
   [NULL +] : 0 = [PRD -], (lambda (wh) wh) :
   0 = [PRD +], (lambda (x) (lambda (wh) (wh x))).
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

Notice that features relevant to N2s are bound between the N2 and the
category value of SLASH---this ensures that whatever restrictions
exist on the gap position are propagated up to the preposed N2 (for
example, 
if the gap is in a position which requires a predicative N2 then this
will force the preposed N2 to be predicative). The feature
specification [NULL +] which defines the daughter in \prevex{} is a
special specification which causes the parser to insert an `E' node in
that position. 

It has been argued in the GPSG literature that preposed subjects of
embedded clauses do not leave behind a gap. GPSG85 has a metarule,
STM2, which terminates a SLASH path at the position of an embedded
subject but which doesn't introduce a gap: our analysis follows suit
(see metarules STM2a and STM2b).  In sentences such as {\it who does
Lee believe kicked him}, although the subject of {\it kicked} is
missing, there is no empty category in this position. Instead, the
embedded S complement of {\it believe} is replaced by a VP. The
structure for this sentence is given in \nextex{}.

There are a few places in the grammar where SLASH introduction,
propagation or elimination does not happen in quite the way described
above. The comparative rules involve departures from the norm
(see section 6.8 below). The coordination rules are also non-standard
because they involve propagating SLASH onto all conjunct daughters
(see section 6.7). As we explained above, SLASH cannot usually
propagate to modifier constituents since these are not sisters of
lexical heads. Arguably, examples such as {\it enthusiastically we set
off for the zoo} involve preposing of a VP modifier but since a
modifier receives the same interpretation whether it attaches to S or
VP and whether it occurs initially or finally (as a predicate which
takes the event variable as an argument), there is no motivation for
producing such an analysis. There is one case, however, which does
seem to involve preposing of a modifier, occurring in some it-cleft
constructions: {\it when was it E that you last saw him}. For just
these cases we have introduced special rules for terminating SLASH on
modifiers (TRACE4 and TRACE5).

In the next subsection we discuss the semantics of unbounded
dependencies and then in the rest of the section we outline briefly
the analysis of some specific types of unbounded dependency
construction.

\subsubsection{Unbounded Dependency Semantics}

The semantic translations associated with unbounded dependencies are
intuitively quite simple although they have proved rather complex to
implement. Basically, a constituent which has a non-NOSLASH value for
SLASH will be looking for one argument more than its [SLASH NOSLASH]
counterpart, i.e.\ over and above its other needs, it is looking for a
constituent to fill the gap that it contains. For this reason, in all
the rules where SLASH may become instantiated either to NOSLASH or to
an actual category, the grammar has to provide a translation for each
of those possibilities.

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
VP/NP : ; abandons his friends
   VP --> H[SUBCAT NP], N2[-PRD] :
   2 = [SLASH NOSLASH], 
    (lambda (Q) (Q 
       (lambda (e) (lambda (x) (1 e x 2)))  
       (lambda (e2) e2)
       (lambda (qu) qu))) :
   2 = [SLASH X2], 
    (lambda (Q) (Q 
       (lambda (e) (lambda (x) (lambda (wh) (1 e x (2 wh)))))
       (lambda (e2) e2) 
       (lambda (qu) qu))).
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

\prevex{} demonstrates this point: the N2 object of a transitive may
end up instantiated as either [SLASH NOSLASH] or as [SLASH X2] (where
X2 must be realised as N2 if the whole N2 is a gap but may be any of
N2, P2 or A2 if the gap is lower down inside the N2). When there is no
gap, then the predicate translating the verb is still looking for an
event argument and a subject argument---{\tt (lambda (e) (lambda (x)
(1 e x 2)))} (remember that the first argument of {\tt Q} is always
the predicate-argument structure). When the N2 either is a gap or
contains a gap then the information about that gap is still to be
found outside of the VP and the {\tt (lambda (wh)} part of the
predicate-argument structure is waiting to pick up that information.
The {\tt (lambda (wh)} associated with a gap is threaded up from the
gap site with each successive translation of local trees until the
antecent of the gap is reached and can be given to the {\tt (lambda
(wh)} as an argument. In \nextex{} we show the successive translations
of the local trees in {\it Lee Kim helps E} in order that the
technique should become clear. By way of contrast, \exnum{+2}{} shows
the successive translations of its non-topicalised counterpart, {\it
Kim helps Lee}.

The techinique of passing up the requirement for information about
gaps is conceptually quite simple but it has involved a high degree of
verbosity in most rules since the translations have to be made
conditional on the presence or absence of a gap. It has also made very
complex the statement of the semantic part of the metarules which
produce alternative slashed versions of some rules. We can demonstrate
the problem by considering the rule in \nextex{}.

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
VP/NP_SFIN1 : ; tells her (that) he can do it
   VP --> H[SUBCAT NP_SFIN, SUBTYPE NONE],

Here the SLASH propagation path is between the mother and the S
daughter and we a need a semantic translation to reflect this path,
i.e.\ we need the following translation where the {\tt wh} variable is
an argument of the translation of the S.

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
(lambda (Q) (Q 
   (lambda (e) (lambda (x) (lambda (wh) 
       (1 e x 2 
          (3 (lambda (prop) (lambda (ta) (lambda (equa)
            (prop (uqe ((equa some) (e3) (ta e3))) wh)))))))))
   (lambda (e2) e2) 
   (lambda (qu) qu))).
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

The problem we have is that in metarules the output semantics is
defined in terms of the input semantics. Usually the lambda calculus
is sufficient to define a function which takes the input semantics and
transforms it into the output but in this case, however, there is no
lambda expression which we can write which can take either of the two
translations in \exnum{-2}{} and turn it into \prevex{}. To solve the
problem we have had to use Lisp to define operators to achieve the
appropriate transformations: slash-operator-1, slash-operator-2 and
slash-operator-3.\footnote{The definitions of these operators can be
found in the file `cmeta-ops'. They must be loaded prior to grammar
compilation.} The definition of the metarule MSLASH1b is as follows:

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
MSLASH1b : ; takes an input where mother and N2 share values for
           ; SLASH and produces an output where mother and some
           ; other [BAR 2] daughter are [SLASH X2] and the N2 is
           ; [SLASH NOSLASH]. See file cmeta-ops for definition
           ; of slash-operator-2.
   [SLASH @, ~INV] --> [H +, BAR 0], N2[-PRD, SLASH @],
   X2[SLASH NOSLASH, UB NO], W.
   ==> [SLASH X2] --> [H +, BAR 0], N2[-PRD, SLASH NOSLASH],
      X2[SLASH X2, BEGAP @b], W :
   2 = [SLASH NOSLASH], slash-operator-2.
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

\subsubsection{Topicalisation}

Topicalised sentences are the simplest type of unbounded dependency.
The topicalised constituent is introduced at the top of a tree by the
S/UDC rules and the SLASH is passed down the tree until it is
terminated. The tree in \exnum{-11}{} is an example of a topicalisation
structure. Semantically, topicalisations receive exactly the same
representation as their non-topicalised counterparts.

\subsubsection{Wh-questions}

Matrix subject wh-questions such as {\it who kicked Lee} do not
involve the SLASH feature or gaps. They receive a structure as in
\nextex{}.

All other kinds of wh-questions are very similar to topicalisations in
that they too involve a preposed constituent and a SLASH passed down
the tree. The difference is that the preposed constituent has values
other than NO for the features WH, UB and EVER which pass up to the
mother node. In addition, the S[SLASH X2] which is the sister of the
preposed constituent is inverted.  The tree in \exnum{-8}{} is an
example of a wh-question, as is the tree in \nextex{}.

Some comment is in order about the propagation of the features WH, UB
and EVER. Together, these features describe the `wh-ness' of
constituents. In releases 1 and 2, a wh version of a rule was derived
from the basic non-wh version by means of metarule. This paralleled
the way slashed versions of rules derived from non-slashed versions.
In this grammar (and in release 3) the changes in the way WH, UB and
EVER are treated parallel the changes in the treatment of SLASH. WH,
UB and EVER now appear on almost all non-lexical major categories.
When a constituent is not a wh-constituent, for example, the N2
{\it the cat}, the features WH, UB and EVER all have the value NO.  A
wh-N2, such as {\it which cat} is specified as [WH +, UB Q, EVER -].
The source of the wh-ness of a constituent is a wh-word which may
appear quite deep inside that constituent: e.g. {\it the height of the
letters on the covers of which}. In many rules, the path of
propagation of wh-ness is quite straightforward in the sense that it
can pass from just one daughter to the mother. For example, in a rule
of the form {\tt N1 --$>$ A2, H1}, the wh-features pass from the head
to the mother. The propagation rules PFOOT1--PFOOT8 set up a pattern
of propagation in rules which are affected by wh-ness so that the
mother and one daughter are bound. The default rules DFOOT1--DFOOT7
default other categories in rules to [WH NO, UB NO, EVER NO].  As is
the case with SLASH propagation, in some rules more than one
propagation pattern is possible. For example in the rule which expands
an N2 as a determiner plus a nominal head, the wh-ness may derive
either from the determiner ({\it which picture of Lee}) or from the
head ({\it a picture of whom}). Where more than one propapagation
pattern can occur, more than one version of the rule has been written
(see for example, N2+/DET1a and N2+/DET2). Second versions could have
been generated by metarule, as is done with SLASH, but in fact the
number of rules affected is so small that it is easier to produce them
by hand.

\subsubsection{Relative Clauses}

For most relative clauses, our account is the same as the GPSG85 account.
Matrix subject relatives receive structures like the following:

Notice that SLASH and gaps are not involved in matrix subject
relatives. The relative pronoun is not preposed but simply occupies
the position of the subject. A similar structure is assigned to
examples with a {\it that} relative pronoun such as {\it the tree that
was blown down}.  The only difference is that the WH feature on the
relative pronoun and the relative clause has the value --.

Non-matrix-subject relatives receive analyses like \nextex{}.

Here the relative pronoun is preposed and its sister is an S[SLASH
N2]. Non-matrix-subject relatives with {\it that} ({\it the window
that you broke E}) are analysed in the same way except that the WH
feature has a negative value again. The grammar also analyses
relatives where the relativiser is a P2 and not an N2 as in {\it the
table on which you put the book}. The grammar is restricted so as to
only allow P2[WH +] relativisers, so examples such as *{\it the table on
that you put the book} will be blocked.

`That'-less relatives receive the analysis in \nextex{}:

Semantically, relative clauses behave just like any other nominal
modifier: they are predicates which are applied to the nominal.
Although relative clauses are syntactically complete Ss, they are
semantically incomplete since they are looking to be predicated of the
nominal in order to be completed. In \nextex{} we show the translation
of the N2 {\it the man who he helped E} and in \exnum{+2}{} we show
the translations associated with relevant subparts of this N2.

\subsubsection{Tough Adjectives}

The rules A1/TOUGH1 and A1/TOUGH2 introduce `tough' adjectives which
appear with a VP[SLASH N2[CASE ACC]] or an S[SLASH N2[CASE ACC]]
complement.  These generate examples such as {\it Lee is easy to annoy
E}, {\it Lee is easy for us to annoy E} as in \nextex{}.  The [CASE ACC]
restriction blocks examples like *{\it Lee is easy to believe likes
cats}, *{\it Lee is easy for us to believe likes cats}.

In the semantics, the subject of the `tough' adjective serves as the
antecedent of the object gap in the complement (and does not act as an
argument of the adjective). When a {\it for}-phrase is present, its N2
is interpreted as the subject argument of the complement, and when it
is absent, a suitable subject is provided ({\tt (pro (the (z1) (entity
z1)))}). \nextex{} illustrates:

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"lee is so easy for kim to annoy E"
(DECL
 (BE (uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1)))
  (EASY
   (ANNOY (uqe (some (e2) (NOTENSE e2)))
          (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
          (name (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (named x2 LEE) (animate x2)))))
   (degree so))))

"lee is so easy to annoy E"
(DECL

\subsubsection{It-Clefts}

The rules VP/BE\_CLEFT1--VP/BE\_CLEFT3 generate it-clefts.
VP/BE\_CLEFT1 is responsible for examples such as {\it it is Lee
who/that relies on Kim}, {\it it is Lee who/that Kim relies on}.
Here, an N2 occurs in focused position and is followed by a relative
clauses to which it is related.  VP/BE\_CLEFT2 deals with examples
such as {\it it is on Lee (that) Kim relies} where a P2 occurs on
focused position and is followed by an S[SLASH P2].  VP/BE\_CLEFT3 is
responsible for examples such as {\it it was in the park that he found
it}, {\it it was seldom that he saw her} and places adverbials in
focused position followed by an S with no gap. Some example trees:

\subsection{Agreement and Control}

\subsubsection{Syntactic Agreement}

In GPSG85, the category valued AGR feature is used both to ensure
subject-verb concord and to ensure an appropriate selection of subject
for control predicates. The positions where AGR must be bound are
defined by reference to the semantic type of a category. Once these
positions have been identified, the Control Agreement Principle
ensures appropriate bindings.  In our grammar agreement positions must
be identified by the grammar writer. Once identified, propagation
rules ensure binding of features on the category value of AGR on some
node to features on a sister of that node. The following agreement
positions have been identified:

In \exnum{-3}{a} and \exnum{-3}{b}, determiners and quantifying
adjectives must agree with their nominal sisters. Propagation rule
AGR/NOM ensures that the values for the features PLU and COUNT on the
nominal category which is the value of AGR on the specifier are bound
to the values for these features on the nominal head, thus blocking
examples such as *{\it a books}, *{\it both book}, *{\it many book}
and *{\it much books}.

In \exnum{-2}{a} and \exnum{-2}{b} there must be agreement between a
VP and its N2 or V2 subject. In the case of the N2 subject,
propagation rule AGR/NP\_VP binds the features PER, PLU, CASE and
NFORM (and somewhat redundantly, COUNT) between the AGR N2 on the VP
and the N2 subject. The binding of the PER and PLU features ensures
agreement whilst the binding of the NFORM feature ensures that a verb
will only occur with the type of N2 subject it requires. For example,
one entry for the verb {\it bother} is specified as [AGR N2[NFORM IT]]
so the binding of AGR ensures that it will only occur with a
pleonastic {\it it} subject. Note that in inverted sentences agreement
occurs between the subject N2 and the inverted verb. Propagation rule
AGR/INV achieves the appropriate binding of values. In the case of the
V2 subject, the values for the features SUBJ, FIN and VFORM are bound
by propagation rule AGR/V2\_VP.  In this way, verbs or adjectives
which require one particular type of V2 subject (finite S, infinitival
S or infinitival VP) will only be able to appear with that type of
subject.

\exnum{-1}{a} and \exnum{-1}{b} are structures in which features on
the category value of SLASH must be bound to features on a
neighbouring category. The trees schematized in \exnum{-1}{a} show the
tops of unbounded dependency constructions where preposed N2, P2, and
A2 must be linked to the value of SLASH on the sister S node.
Propagation rules SLASH/AGR\_NP1, SLASH/AGR\_PP1 and SLASH/AGR\_AP are
the rules which ensure this link. \exnum{-1}{b} is the kind of
structure resulting from the slash termination metarules STM2a and
STM2b mentioned in the previous section. Here a [SLASH N2[+NOM]] is
not terminated by a gap but instead the finite S complement in which
it would have appeared is replaced by a finite VP. In order to ensure
agreement between the preposed N2 and the VP whose subject it is,
features such as PLU, PER and CASE must be bound between the N2 value
of SLASH and the N2 value of AGR on that VP---propogation rule
SLASH/AGR\_NP3 does just that. In this way we block ill-formed
examples such as *{\it those children I believe lives in our street}.

The tree in \prevex{a} exemplifies the configuration in which object
control verbs appear.  Here the N2 object also functions as the
subject argument of the VP or A2 complement. Accordingly, propagation
rule OBJ\_CONTROL binds the values for the features PER, PLU, NFORM
and COUNT on the [AGR N2] on the VP or A2 to values for these features
on the N2 object. The only feature that is really of significance here
is NFORM since this restricts the type of N2 which can occur as
object.  In object equi cases (see ID rules VP/OE*) the N2 must be
[NFORM NORM] so the NFORM value on the AGR N2 on the VP or A2 must
also be NORM. This ensures that examples such as {\it persuade Lee to
read} will be parsed whilst *{\it persuade it to bother Lee that Kim
reads} will not.  In the case of object raising (see ID rules VP/OR*),
the NFORM value on the N2 is unspecified with the result that all of
{\it believe Lee to be a fool}, {\it believe it to bother Lee that Kim
reads}, {\it believe there to be elephants in the garden} will be
parsed. A number of different types of VP complement are possible:
infinitival ones ({\it believe Lee to like bananas}); -ing form ones
({\it see Lee running to the shop}); base form ones ({\it make Lee run
to the shop}) and passive ones ({\it get Lee arrested}). The verbs
which head object control VPs determine the form of their complement by
being specified differently for their SUBCAT feature. The verbs just
given as examples are specified as [SUBCAT OC\_INF], [SUBCAT OC\_ING],
[SUBCAT OC\_BSE] and [SUBCAT OC\_PASS] respectively. Similarly, it is
the verbs which determine whether the construction is a raising or equi
construction: raising verbs are [SUBTYPE RAIS] and equi verbs are
[SUBTYPE EQUI].

The trees in \prevex{b} and \prevex{c} are subject control
environments. Here there is no N2 object to be interpreted as the
subject of the VP or A2 complement. Instead, the subject of the mother
VP or A1 must be interpreted as the subject of the complement -- the
`@x' in the trees indicates that they share the same AGR value and
hence the same subject. The SUBJ\_CONTROL propagation rules ensure
this identity of values.  In the case of subject equi, the control
predicate (such as {\it try}, {\it feel} or {\it eager}) is specified
as [AGR N2[NFORM NORM]] and this means that the only kind of VP or A2
complement that can occur here will also have to be [AGR N2[NFORM
NORM]]. Examples such as *{\it it tries to bother Lee that Kim reads},
*{\it there feel likely to be elephants in the garden}, *{\it that Kim
reads is eager to bother Lee} will therefore be blocked. In the case
of subject raising predicates (such as {\it tend}, {\it likely} and
the auxiliaries and modals) there is no restriction on the type of
subject that these predicates can occur with and hence no restriction
on the AGR value of their VP or A2 complements. Subjects can be V2s of
any type or N2s of any type---in a sense these predicates simply
inherit the agreement properties of their complements. The result is
that sets of sentences such as {\it Kim seems to read}, {\it it seems
to bother Kim that Lee reads}, {\it there seem to be elephants in the
garden}, {\it that Kim reads seems to bother Lee}, {\it for us to go
seems to be possible}, {\it to go seems to be possible} are all
accepted by the grammar. As with the object control verbs, it is
subject control verbs or adjectives which determine the form of their
controlled complement. Subject control verbs may select infinitival VP
complements ({\it try to help}---[SUBCAT SC\_INF]); -ing form VP
complements ({\it like helping}---[SUBCAT SC\_ING]); base form VP
complements ({\it dare be rude}---[SUBCAT SC\_BSE]); passive VP
complements ({\it get arrested}--[SUBCAT SC\_PASS] and A2 complements
({\it seem stupid}--[SUBCAT SC\_AP]). Subject control adjectives may
select infinitival VP complements ({\it eager to help}---[SUBCAT
SC\_INF]); -ing form VP complements ({\it busy helping}---[SUBCAT
SC\_ING]) and A2 complements ({\it scared silly}--[SUBCAT SC\_AP]). As
with object control verbs, subject control predicates also determine
whether the control relationship is a raising one ([SUBTYPE RAIS]) or
an equi one ([SUBTYPE EQUI]).

The tree in \prevex{d} is the one in which the verbs {\it promise} and
{\it strike as} appear.  These verbs are peculiar in that although
they occur in an environment typical of object control verbs, they are
in fact subject control verbs.  The N2 object is not to be construed
as the subject of the VP complement.  The ID rules introducing {\it
promise} (VP/SE\_NP\_INF) and {\it strike as} (VP/SR\_NP\_AP) are
correctly bound by the propagation rule SUBJ\_CONTROL5 and not by the
OBJ\_CONTROL one.

A few more control ID rules, VP/SR\_NP, VP/SR\_NP\_PHR, VP/SE\_NP,
VP/SE\_NP\_PHR, VP/OR\_NP and VP/OE\_NP generate examples such as {\it
seem a fool}, {\it turn out a fool}, {\it look a fool}, {\it end up a
fool}, {\it consider Lee a hero} and {\it make Kim a hero}.  These are
clearly a kind of control environment but syntactically there is no
agreement process since nominal categories are not specified with an
AGR feature.

\subsubsection{The Semantics of Control}

The syntactic aspects of control constructions are mirrored by the
semantic translations assigned to them. Here, the distinction between
raising predicates and equi ones is crucial. The controlled complement
has a translation as a proposition which still needs a subject
argument. In the case of equi predicates, one of their other arguments
plays two roles: firstly as an argument of the equi predicate and
secondly as the missing subject argument of the embedded proposition.
To give an example, the VP complement of {\it try} in {\it Kim tries
to help often} has the translation in \nextex{}.

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"to help often"
(lambda (Q1) (Q1 
    (lambda (e1) (lambda (x1) (HELP e1 x1)))
    (lambda (e2) e2) 
    (lambda (qu1) often)))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

The first argument of {\tt Q1}, {\tt (lambda (e1) (lambda (x1) (HELP
e1 x1)))}, is the predicate argument structure associated with the VP
and it is still in need of information both about its event argument
({\tt (lambda (e1)..}) and its subject argument ({\tt (lambda (x1)
..}). The rule which combines this VP with a subject equi verb,
VP/SE\_INF, makes sure that both the matrix VP and the embedded VP
will receive the interpretation of the matrix subject as their subject
argument. At the same time it puts together the tense and aspect and
quantifier information about the VP (which up until now has been kept
separate as the second and third arguments of {\tt Q1}) in order to
provide a complete proposition interpretation as an argument to the
equi predicate.\footnote{Our treatment differs from a property
theoretic approach (Chierchia 1985, Chierchia \& Turner 1988) which
provides a property as an argument to the control predicate rather
than a complete proposition, i.e.\ it does not resolve the control
relation at the level of compositional interpretation. See Dowty
(1985) for an evaluation of the differences between the two
approaches.} The rule is given in \nextex{}, the translation of the
VP {\it tries to help often} in \exnum{+2}{} and the final
translation of {\it Kim tries to help often} in \exnum{+3}{}.

The analysis of raising predicates is very similar to the analysis of
equi ones except that the constituent from the matrix clause which
provides the subject information for the controlled complement's
semantics does not actually play a role with respect to the matrix
clause semantics. The subject raising example, {\it Kim seems to help
often}, has an analysis which is almost the same as the equi example,
{\it Kim tries to help often}, just described. The translation for the
controlled complement {\it to help often} is as given in \exnum{-3}{},
the rule in \nextex{} is the one which builds the VP {\it seems to help
often} and the translations for this and the complete sentence are
given in \exnum{+2}{}.

\normalsize

If we compare these examples with the ones for {\it try}, we see that
the predicate SEEM has one argument fewer than TRY---its subject is
a semantic argument of the controlled complement but plays no role
with respect to SEEM itself.

Object control predicates have a similar semantics to subject control
ones except that it is an object of the matrix predicate which is
interpreted as the subject of the controlled complement. The
equi/raising distinction is treated in the same way: object equi
predicates have one more argument than corresponding raising ones
because their object plays a role both in the matrix clause and the
controlled complement while the objects of object raising predicates
only participate in the semantics of the controlled complement. The
examples in \nextex{} demonstrate the analysis of object equi and
object raising predicates respectively.

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim tells lee to help"
(DECL
 (TELL (uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1)))
       (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
       #1=(name (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (named x2 LEE) (animate x2))))
       (HELP (uqe (some (e2) (NOTENSE e2))) #1#)))

"kim believes lee to help"
(DECL

          (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))

                      (named x2 LEE) (animate x2)))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

The auxiliary and modal rules behave syntactically as if they are
control verbs. In the case of the tense/aspect auxiliaries the
relationship is like a raising relationship since the auxiliary
acquires the type of subject which its complement needs ({\it it had
been raining}, {\it there is a book on the table}, {\it that Lee won
that race will annoy Lee} etc.) Semantically, however, these
auxiliaries are not like raising verbs because they do not contribute
a predicate of their own to the translation---they only contribute
tense and aspect information:

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"it had been raining"
(DECL 
  (RAIN (uqe (some (e1) (PAST (PERF (PROG e1)))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

Modal verbs tend to be ambiguous between an epistemic meaning ({\it
this must be Glasgow}) and a deontic meaning ({\it he must behave
himself}). When they have an epistemic reading they behave
syntactically like raising verbs in that they occur with whichever
subject their complement needs: {\it it must be raining}, {\it that
Kim won the race must annoy you}. Like the tense/aspect auxiliaries,
however, they do not behave like raising predicates semantically
because they do not contribute a predicate to the translation
---instead they contribute a modal operator scoping over the whole
proposition \nextex{a}. When modals have a deontic reading they behave
syntactically like equi verbs since they can only take an N2[NFORM
NORM] subject---examples with non-normal subjects only ever have an
epistemic reading and never a deontic one. Semantically we treat the
deontic interpretations in the same way as equi predicates: the
modal contributes a predicate to the translation and the subject plays
a role with respect both to the modal and to the complement predicate
\nextex{b}.

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"he may stand up"

a.  (DECL (POS ((CP STAND UP) 
                  (uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1)))
                  (pro (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (male x1)))))))

b.  (DECL (MAY (uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1))) 
               #1=(pro (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (male x1))))
               ((CP STAND UP) 
                   (uqe (some (e2) (NOTENSE e2))) 
                   #1#)))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

We keep only one lexical entry for modal verbs and therefore achieve
only one parse of a sentence involving a modal. The semantic
translation, however, is organised so that two readings will result
from the parse. In order to get two translations, the entries for
ambiguous modals have a semantics which keeps both the epistemic
operator and the deontic predicate available: the semantics for the
entry for {\it must} is {\tt (lambda (int) (int NEC MUST))}. The modal
rules, VP/MODAL1a--VP/MODAL2, give two interpretations for VPs which
are [AGR N2[NFORM NORM]] using, in one, the epistemic operator and, in
the other, the deontic predicate. When AGR is instantiated in other
ways only the epistemic translation is given.  Apart from this we are
unable to disambiguate between the two readings.

\subsection{Negation}

The grammar deals with forms of negation involving the presence in a
sentence of the word {\it not}, either free-standing or cliticized to
an auxiliary or modal (e.g.\ {\it can't}, {\it doesn't}).  The syntax
of cliticized {\it not} is quite simple: the contracted forms, which
are all finite, have lexical entries marked as [NEG +] and are able to
be picked up by the normal auxiliary and modal rules. In general,
wherever a non-negative finite [AUX +] verb can occur, so can a
negative one ({\it Kim can swim}, {\it Kim can't swim}). The
distribution of free-standing {\it not} is controlled by means of both
a metarule and some ID rules. 

\small

NEGATION : ; takes an aux or modal rule and returns a new

The metarule NEGATION, as shown in \prevex{}, takes [AUX +] VP rules
and derives a new set of rules from them which are the same except
that a {\it not} occurs between the head and the VP complement and the
new rules are restricted to be finite. This permits examples such as
{\it has not eaten}, {\it could not help it} etc. The metarule
accounts for a good many occurrences of {\it not} but does not cover
all possibilities. For example, it does not cover cases such as {\it may
have not eaten} since the {\it not} occurs with a non-finite auxiliary.
Most other cases are accounted for by the rule VP/NEG
as shown in \nextex{}.

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
VP/NEG : ; (does) not dance. -FIN prevents 'not dances'
   VP[NEG +] --> [NEG +], H2[SUBJ -, FIN -, NEG -] :
   2 = [SLASH NOSLASH],
      (2 (lambda (prop) (lambda (ta) (lambda (equa)
           (lambda (Q) (Q (lambda (e) (lambda (x) 
             (NOT (prop e x)))) ta equa)))))) :
   2 = [SLASH X2],
      (2 (lambda (prop) (lambda (ta) (lambda (equa) 
           (lambda (Q) (Q (lambda (e) (lambda (x) (lambda (wh) 
             (NOT (prop e x wh))))) ta equa)))))).
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

This rule allows {\it not} to precede any non-finite VP and therefore
permits all of the following:

\begin{ex}
\begin{subex}
Kim may not have been being told off.
\end{subex}
\begin{subex}
Kim may have not been being told off.
\end{subex}
\begin{subex}
Kim may have been not being told off.
\end{subex}
\begin{subex}
Kim may have been being not told off.
\end{subex}
\end{ex}

The careful reader will have noticed that \prevex{a} can also be
generated as a result of the metarule in \exnum{-2}{}: in fact
\prevex{a} does get two parses which receive different semantic
interpretations (see below). The two structures are:

Examples involving finite tense/aspect auxiliaries do not so easily
give rise to an ambiguity as ones with modals and so we block the
possibility of a parse involving the VP/NEG rule in such cases. To do this
we use a slightly complex interaction of the two features NEG and
CONEG (as described in section 3.1.1.1) which results in us blocking
the use of VP/NEG when the auxiliary is [NEG --] ({\it Kim does not
leave}) but permitting it when the auxiliary is [NEG +] ({\it Kim
doesn't not leave}), since the NEGATION metarule will not handle this
case.

There are one or two places where {\it not} can appear in constituents
other than VP and for these we have provided specific rules. ID rule
A2/NOT permits {\it not} before a quantifier ({\it not many}, {\it not
often}); PS rule NEG/DETA allows {\it not} before a degree specifier
({\it not too}, {\it not so}); ID rules N2+/NEG, A2/NEG and P2/NEG
permit {\it not} to occur inside coordinations of N2, A2 and P2 ({\it
a cat but not a dog}, {\it happy and not tired}, {\it under the table
and not on it}); PS rule P/NEG allows {\it not} in coordinations of P
({\it under and not on the table}); ID rule VP/PRO/NEG allows {\it
not} to occur after a [PRO +] verb ({\it but he did not}).

Semantically, negation is usually treated by means of the propositional
operator NOT:

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"the abbot didn't abdicate"
(DECL
 (NOT
  (ABDICATE (uqe (some (e1) (PAST e1)))
   (dd (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (ABBOT x1)))))))

"lee was not helping"
(DECL
 (NOT
  (HELP (uqe (some (e1) (PAST (PROG e1))))
   (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 LEE) (animate x1)))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

In a few cases the question arises whether the operator NOT should
scope over a higher proposition or an embedded one, or whether it
should scope over another propositional operator or not. In the case
of modals, two parses are produced, one by means of the NEGATION
metarule and one by means of ID rule VP/NEG (as described above), and
each parse corresponds to a different scoping. Since modals are
already ambiguous between epistemic and deontic readings, four
interpretations usually result from a sentence with a modal and
non-cliticised negation:

\small 
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim must not be helping the abbot"
(DECL
 (NOT
  (NEC
   (HELP (uqe (some (e1) (PRES (PROG e1))))
    (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
    (dd (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (ABBOT x2))))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\vspace{4mm}
\begin{splitex}
\begin{verbatim}
(DECL
 (NOT
  (MUST (uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1)))
   #1=(name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
   (HELP (uqe (some (e2) (NOTENSE (PROG e2)))) #1#
    (dd (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (ABBOT x2))))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{splitex}
\vspace{4mm}
\begin{splitex}
\begin{verbatim}
(DECL

  (NOT
   (HELP (uqe (some (e1) (PRES (PROG e1))))
    (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
    (dd (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (ABBOT x2))))))))

    (dd (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (ABBOT x2))))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{splitex}
\normalsize

Of course, in many cases only one or two of these interpretations are
actual possibilities but we do not have access to sufficient
information (such as whether an event is a state or an activity) to
disambiguate at this point.

In a few cases the negative marker NOT is used not as a propositional
operator but as part of predicate or a quantifier:

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"not many abbeys fall down"
(DECL
 ((CP FALL DOWN) (uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1)))
  (uq ((NOT many) (x1) (and (pl x1) (ABBEY x1))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}

"kim is not very eager"

  (EAGER (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
   (degree (NOT very)))))

  (BE (uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1)))

\subsection{Coordination}

Because our system uses fixed-arity term unification (instead of
graph-theoretic unification with extension), no general elegant
treatment of coordination, such as the GPSG coordination schemata, is
available to us.  Instead, coordination rules have to be stated for
each of the major category types. All of the coordination rules induce
broadly the same analysis, however, and a schematic example is given in
\nextex{}.

Coordinators are treated as being in constituency with the conjuncts
that follow them. Where there is no coordinator, as with the first
conjunct in {\it the dog and the cat}, the conjunct has the feature
specification [CONJ NULL]. No special rules are need for this: all
major category constituents are marked as [CONJ NULL] to indicate that
they can appear as a coordinator-less conjunct. The order in which
conjuncts can occur is controlled by LP rule LP9 which allows the
following possibilities: NULL...AND, NULL...OR, NULL...BUT, BOTH...AND,
NEITHER...NOR, EITHER...OR.

Rules have been provided for coordinations of N2 ({\it the dog and the
cat}), N1 ({\it the clever dogs and stupid cats}), N ({\it the clever
dogs and cats}), S ({\it Lee sings and Kim dances}), VP ({\it reads
books and understands them}), V ({\it reads and understands books}),
P2 ({\it on the table and under it}), P ({\it on and under the table}),
A2 ({\it exceptionally clever and clearly capable of learning}), A1
({\it so clever but so arrogant}) and A ({\it too clever and
arrogant}).

Because GPSG uses a more complex category matching technique than
ours, it is able to treat all conjuncts as heads. This is not possible
in our grammar, however, since it would entail that all conjuncts had
the same values for their head features, and counterexamples to this
are numerous. As a result, apart from coordinations of V and A,
conjuncts are not treated as heads. Instead our analysis treats them
as partial heads---for each type of coordination a subset of head
features have been identified which must be shared between conjuncts.
Various propagation rules ensure correct bindings for these features
(see the propagation rules named COORD/...  and the sets
CONJ\_NOMHEAD, CONJ\_ADJHEAD etc.).

The rules for coordinations of nominal categories are rather complex
since an attempt has been made to describe the propagation of number
(the feature PLU) in these cases.  For example, the grammar reflects
the fact that a coordination of N2s with {\it and} will always be [PLU
+], irrespective of the PLU values of the conjuncts, whilst the PLU
value of a coordination with {\it or} is dependent on the PLU values
of the conjuncts. A correct statement of person (PER) propagation, on
the other hand, proved too difficult to implement so PER is left
underspecified on the mother of a coordination.

While it is generally the case that only like categories can be
coordinated, there are well known exceptions to this rule. There are
particular positions where unlike categories may be coordinated. These
positions are, firstly, after copula {\it be} where any X2[+PRD]
category may be coordinated with any other X2[+PRD] ({\it Lee is in
the bath and singing}, {\it Lee is a fool and unable to learn} etc.)
and secondly, in modifier of V2 positions where any X2[+ADV]
categories may be coordinated ({\it Lee sings tunelessly but with
great gusto}, {\it Lee works at a fast rate but carelessly}). ID rules
PRD/COORD1--PRD/COORD6 and CONJ/PRD allow for coordinations of
X2[+PRD] categories, whilst ID rules MOD/COORD1--MOD/COORD6,
CONJ/MOD1 and CONJ/MOD2 allow for coordinations of adverbial
categories. The fact that these are coordinations of special X2
categories (as described in sections 3.1.1.5, 3.1.1.6 and 5.6) means
that their distribution is limited to the positions outlined above.

Extractions out of coordinations may only occur in an
`across-the-board' fashion. That is, if one conjunct contains a gap,
then so must all the other conjuncts ({\it who is it that John likes E
but Bill hates E} vs *{\it who is it that John likes E but Bill hates
Mary}). Propagation rule PSLASH8 binds SLASH on the mother of a
coordination to SLASH on all of the daughters thereby ensuring an
across-the-board pattern of extraction. In addition, though conjuncts
can contain gaps, they cannot {\it be} gaps: *{\it who did you meet
John and E}, *{\it who did you meet E and E}. To reflect this,
conjuncts are marked as [BEGAP --].

Semantically, coordination is usually simply reflected by semantic
conjunction or disjunction. We use upper case {\tt AND} and {\tt OR}
instead of the lower case {\tt and} and {\tt or} which occur elsewhere
in our semantic representations, in order to preserve the information
that this conjunction/disjunction is the result of syntactic
coordination. Some examples of the semantic representations of
coordinations of N2, A2 and P2 are given in \nextex{}.

The method of building the semantic representations for coordinated
VPs and Ss is quite complicated. When sentences are coordinated there
must be a separate event argument for each conjunct, for example, {\it
Kim left and Lee arrived} describes two events, the event of Kim
leaving and the event of Lee arriving.  To understand why the
translation of coordinated S should be complex, consider how the
translation of an S is usually built:

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim left" --- S node
(lambda (Q1) (Q1 
  (lambda (e1) (LEAVE e1 
      (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))))
  (lambda (e2) (PAST e2)) 
  (lambda (qu1) qu1)))

"kim left" --- TOP node
(DECL
 (LEAVE (uqe (some (e1) (PAST e1)))
        (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
T1 : ; root symbol for the parser. It is here that the information
     ; that root sentences are always finite is encoded. This
     ; means that the parser gives two parses for finite sentences
     ; (one as T, one as S) whilst only one parse for non-finite
     ; sentences (as S)
   [T S] --> S[H +, COMP NORM, +FIN] :
   1 = [VFORM NOT, INV -], (DECL
         (1 (lambda (prop) (lambda (ta) (lambda (equa)
                     (prop (uqe ((equa some) (e) (ta e))))))))) :
   1 = [VFORM NOT, INV +],
      (YNQU (1 (lambda (prop) (lambda (ta) (lambda (equa)
                     (prop (uqe ((equa some) (e) (ta e))))))))) :
   1 = [VFORM BSE],
      (IMP (1 (lambda (prop) (lambda (ta) (lambda (equa)
                     (prop (uqe ((equa some) (e) (ta e))))))))).
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

The translation of an S node is one where the parts of the proposition
it denotes are present but where they have not yet been put together
to form the completed proposition. The reason for not putting them
together is that further information from S modifiers may need to be
incorporated (e.g.\ {\it (angrily S( Kim left))}) and so the complete
proposition is only put together when it is certain that the S is
syntactically complete, i.e.\ when it occurs as a daughter of some
other constituent. It occurs, for example, as the daughter of the TOP
node category and the rule that builds the translation for this
(reproduced in \prevex{}) takes the parts and puts them together in the
appropriate way. The rule takes the tense and aspect information ({\tt
(lambda (e2) (PAST e2))} and {\tt (lambda (qu1) qu1)}, the second and
third arguments of {\tt Q}) and builds an event argument out of them
which it then gives to the predicate-argument structure ({\tt (lambda
(e1) (LEAVE e1 (pro (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (male x1))))))}, the first
argument of {\tt Q}).

In the case of coordinated S, we want each conjunct to have a separate
event argument, but the rules which put an S together only hand one
event to the predicate argument structure. To bypass this problem we
complete each S conjunct, giving each a distinct event argument, as
part of the process of building the coordination. However, we have to
return a translation for the whole which is of the form that rules
taking S as a daughter expect. We therefore build a representation
which has an already complete form embedded inside vacuous lambda
abstractions. The example in \nextex{} demonstrates:

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim left"
(lambda (Q1) (Q1
    (lambda (e1) (LEAVE e1 
        (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))))
    (lambda (e2) (PAST e2)) 
    (lambda (qu1) qu1)))

"and lee arrived"
(lambda (Q1) (Q1
  (lambda (e1) (ARRIVE e1 
      (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 LEE) (animate x1))))))
  (lambda (e2) (PAST e2)) 
  (lambda (qu1) qu1)))


"kim left and lee arived" --- S node
(lambda (F1)
 (F1
  (lambda (lose1)
   (AND
    (LEAVE (uqe (some (e1) (PAST e1)))
     (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1)))))
    (ARRIVE (uqe (some (e2) (PAST e2)))
     (name (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (named x2 LEE) (animate x2)))))))
  lta lequa))


"kim left and lee arrived" --- TOP node
(DECL
 (AND
  (LEAVE (uqe (some (e1) (PAST e1)))
   (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1)))))
  (ARRIVE (uqe (some (e2) (PAST e2)))
   (name (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (named x2 LEE) (animate x2)))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

We achieve a similar treatment for coordinated VPs whereby each
conjunct has a separate event argument although they all have the same
subject argument. A similar method has to be used as with S
coordination, assigning a coordinate VP a translation which is
already more complete than usual and which involves vacuous lambda
abstraction at the top of the coordination. 

The treatment of coordinated VP and S involves more complications than
achieving separate event arguments however. There are many places
where some item in a sentence containing an S or a VP coordination has
be integrated into the translation of each conjunct even though it
occurs only once outside the coordination. For coordinations of S,
premodifiers such as {\it often} and {\it angrily} as in {\it often
Lee helped Kim and Kim helped Lee}, {\it angrily Lee accused Kim and
Kim left the room}, can be given syntactic scope over both conjuncts
and need a corresponding semantic scope too. This involves adding the
information provided by the modifier into the translation of each
conjunct:

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"often kim helped lee and lee helped kim"
(DECL
 (AND
  (HELP (uqe (often (e1) (PAST e1)))
   (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
   (name (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (named x2 LEE) (animate x2)))))
  (HELP (uqe (often (e2) (PAST e2)))
   (name (the (x3) (and (sg x3) (named x3 LEE) (animate x3))))
   (name (the (x4) (and (sg x4) (named x4 KIM) (animate x4)))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

In the case of VPs there are many more items which scope over both
conjuncts and whose translations have to be integrated with each
conjunct. With sequences of auxiliaries, for example, a coordination
may happen at the main verb level but tense and aspect information
from higher up scopes over both conjuncts and has to be incorporated
into each proposition that translates the conjuncts. For example, in
{\it Kim will have been reading that book and thinking about it},
tense information from {\it will} and aspect information from {\it
have} and {\it been} occurs outside of the coordination but needs to
be integrated into the translation of the conjuncts, as in \nextex{}.

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim will have been reading that book and thinking about it"
(DECL
 (AND
  (READ 
     (uqe (some (e1) (FUT (PERF (PROG e1)))))
     #1=(name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
     (dd (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (distal x2) (BOOK x2)))))
  ((CP THINK ABOUT) 
     (uqe (some (e2) (FUT (PERF (PROG e2))))) 
     #1#
     (pro (the (x3) (and (or (sg x3) (ms x3)) (nonhuman x3)))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

In other cases, quantifiers and modifiers scope over coordinations of
VPs and have to be integrated into all conjuncts:

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim frequently cooks and washes up"
(DECL (AND
  (COOK (uqe (frequently (e1) (PRES e1)))
   #1=(name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1)))))
  ((CP WASH UP) (uqe (seldom (e2) (PRES e2))) #1#)))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\vspace{4mm}
\begin{splitex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim sang and danced beautifully"
(DECL (AND
  (and
   (SING #1=(uqe (some (e1) (PAST e1)))
    #2=(name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1)))))
   (#3=(BEAUTIFULLY) #1#))
  (and
   (DANCE #4=(uqe (some (e2) (PAST e2))) #2#)
   (#3# #4#))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{splitex}
\normalsize

What we do in the semantics, in effect, is reconstruct the full
sentences that an ellipsis or deletion account of coordination would
claim underlies the VP coordination.\footnote{We are aware that there are
situations where it would be more desirable to think of a coordination
of VPs as representing just one event, not two (or more) but we have
chosen to implement a `reconstruct the ellipsis' account since this is
what is needed in a large number of cases and since it is more
difficult to achieve than the alternative. There is no reason why the
alternative should not be added to the grammar as well with the result
that VP coordinations would always be ambiguous. Finding
disambiguation proceedures, however, might not be easy.} We achieve this
reconstruction at the cost of complicating still further a part of the
grammar which is already quite complex enough. We use a feature ELLIP
to indicate whether a constituent is one which is looking for
information which it needs to complete itself. For example, in the
sentence {\it often Kim will have been reading that book and thinking
about it}, ELLIP distributes as follows:

We have separate rules for [ELLIP +] constituents and [ELLIP --] ones.
Rules whose name starts with `ELL/' are ones for building and
translating [ELLIP +] constituents. The translations are done using
complex lambda expressions which look ouside of the constituent for
information needed to complete it.  There is also a metarule callked
ELL/SAI which achieves subject-auxiliary inversion for the [ELLIP +]
auxiliary rules ELL/VP/DO1, ELL/VP/HAVE, ELL/VP/WILL, ELL/VP/BE\_PRD.
The result is a rather complex set of rules which achieve the desired
translation in most cases but which are sometimes unreliable. We have
not by any means addressed all of the issues which arise in the
semantics of coordination.

\subsection{Comparatives}

\subsubsection{Syntax}

Our analysis of comparatives is loosely based on an account in Gazdar
(1980).  It is not exhaustive, but it recognises all of the following:

\begin{tabular}[t]{llll}
\multicolumn{4}{l}{Nominal comparatives:} \\
\ \ & \ \ & \ \ & \ \   \\

\end{tabular}
    
The (a) examples are comparatives whilst the (b) ones are equatives.
Since the latter receive the same treatment as the former the
illustrations will refer mostly to comparatives.  {\it Than} and {\it
as} have entries both as prepositions and as complementisers.  The
preposition occurs in \exnum{-11}{}, \exnum{-8}{}, \exnum{-6}{} and
\exnum{-1}{} and the complementiser in all the others. In all the
nominal examples, the basic structure assigned is one where an
N2[+SPEC] rewrites as an N2[--SPEC] followed by the {\it than}/{\it
as} constituent. The value for AFORM on the N2[--SPEC] (which it
inherits from its quantifier) is bound to the value for PFORM or
COMP on the other daughter to ensure that {\it than} is paired with
{\it more} or {\it +er} and {\it as} is paired with {\it as}.
Similarly, in the adjectival rules, an A2 dominates an A1 head and a
{\it than}/{\it as} constituent. AFORM on the A2 is bound to PFORM or
COMP on the other daughter. The basic structures are therefore as
follows:

In all cases, the {\it than}/{\it as} constituent can be thought of as
semantically elliptical (see below) and in some of the rules the use of
SLASH reflects this. The range of possible {\it than}/{\it as}
constituents are as follows:

\begin{tabular}[t]{llll}
\addtocounter{examplectr}{1}
(\arabic{examplectr})
    & a & more books than Lee                 & P2 \\

\ \ & c & more books than you'd think         & S[SLASH S] \\
\ \ & d & more books than Lee does            & S[SLASH VP] \\
\ \ & e & more books than magazines           & P2[SLASH +QUA] \\
\ \ & f & more books than Lee reads magazines & S[SLASH +QUA] \\
\ \ & \ \ & \ \                               & \ \    \\
\addtocounter{examplectr}{1}
(\arabic{examplectr}) 
    & a & more stupid than Lee                & P2 \\
\ \ & b & taller than Lee is                  & S[SLASH A2] \\

\ \ & d & more aggressive than I thought      & S[SLASH S] \\

\ \ & f & more stupid than wicked             & A2[SLASH +QUA] \\
\ \ & g & more stupid than Lee is wicked      & S[SLASH +QUA] \\
\end{tabular}

The P2 in \exnum{-1}{a} and \prevex{a} is a standard non-predicative P2.
The S[SLASH N2] and S[SLASH A2] in \exnum{-1}{b} and \prevex{b} are
standard gappy constituents, containing an N2 gap and an A2 gap
respectively ({\it than Kim reads E}, {\it than Kim is E}). The S in
\prevex{c} is an unslashed version of \prevex{b} specially provided for
when the A2 is a modifier rather than a complement (we do not have
modifier gaps). The S[SLASH S] and S[SLASH VP] in \exnum{-1}{c},
\exnum{-1}{d}, \prevex{d} and \prevex{e} are instances of a category that
only ever appears in comparative constructions. There are no gaps
corresponding to [SLASH VP] and [SLASH S]---instead [SLASH VP] is
terminated by the rule in \nextex{} which rewrites a VP[SLASH VP] as a
[PRO +] auxiliary. [SLASH S] is terminated by means of the special
metarules STM3a and STM3b which generate new versions of rules with
finite S complements which lack the S complement. STM3a and STM3b are
shown in \exnum{+2}{}.

\subsubsection{Semantics of Nominal Comparatives}

We produce semantic representations for nominal comparatives which are
very similar to those described in Pulman (1991). The translation of the
{\it than}/{\it as} phrase forms a complex quantifier with the {\it
more}/{\it as}, as illustrated in \nextex{}.

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim eats more apples than lee eats"
(DECL (EAT (uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1)))
  (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
  (uq (((more than)
     (lambda (c1) (and (and (pl c1) (APPLE c1))
       (EAT (uqe (some (e2) (PRES e2)))
        (name (the (x3) (and (sg x3) (named x3 LEE) (animate x3)))) c1))))
    (x2) (and (pl x2) (APPLE x2))))))

The three examples in \prevex{} are produced by means of different rules
(N2+/COMPAR3, N2+/COMPAR4 and N2+/COMPAR1 respectively). The translation
of the first example, {\it Kim eats more apples than Lee eats}, is the
most complete representation of the three. It contains the complex
quantifer \\
{\tt ((more than) (lambda (c1) (and (and (pl c1) (APPLE c1)) \\
\hspace{4mm} (EAT (uqe (some (e2) (PRES e2))) \\
\hspace{8mm} (name (the (x3) (and (sg x3) (named x3 LEE) (animate x3)))) 
c1))))} \\
where {\tt (more than)} takes as an argument
the set described by \\
{\tt (lambda (c1) (and (and (pl c1) (APPLE c1)) \\ 
\hspace{4mm} (EAT (uqe (some (e2) (PRES e2))) \\
\hspace{8mm} (name (the (x3) (and (sg x3) (named x3 LEE)
(animate x3)))) c1)))}. \\ This set is the set of apples such that Lee ate
them. The interpretation of the {\tt ((more than) ..)} quantifier can
therefore be glossed as `a quantity which is greater than the size of the
set {\tt (lambda (c1)...)}'.  Although the second and third examples in
\prevex{} mean much the same as the first, they do not explicitly contain
a predicate in the {\it than}/{\it as} phrase since it has proved too
complex to try to inherit this information from the main clause as part of
the process of translation. Our alternative is to provide a `pro'
predicate whose antecedent must be found by a resolution component. In
the case of the third example, the only thing we know is that there is a
predicate which has at least three arguments, {\it Lee}, an unknown
quantity of apples and an event argument with unknown tense properties.
We represent this with the atom PROPRED. In the case of the second
example, we know a little more---we know that {\it Lee} is the subject of
the missing predicate and we know its tense. Continuing our usual
treatment of VP ellipsis we represent this with PROVP.

\nextex{} illustrates our treatment of examples which involve terminating
a [SLASH S] by removing the finite S complement of a verb. Again we use
PROPRED but here it represents the missing complement of THINK. All that
we can infer about this predicate is that one of its argument is {\it
apples} and one is an event argument (with no tense information). 

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim ate more apples than he thought"
(DECL
 (EAT (uqe (some (e1) (PAST e1)))
  (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
  (uq
   (((more than)
     (lambda (c1)
      (and (and (pl c1) (APPLE c1))
       (THINK (uqe (some (e2) (PAST e2)))
        (pro (the (x3) (and (sg x3) (male x3))))
        (PROPRED (uqe (some (e3) (NOTENSE e3))) c1)))))
    (x2) (and (pl x2) (APPLE x2))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

Nominal comparatives with a [SLASH +QUA] {\it than}/{\it as} phrase
are ones where only a quantifier is missing. Our analysis currently
gives the translation in \nextex{} for {\it Kim eats more apples than
Lee eats pears} but this is not the translation we would want to
achieve. Ideally we would want a translation which paralleled the
examples in \exnum{-1}{} (as shown in \exnum{+2}{}) but this would
involve adding additional clauses to all the VP rules and this is too
high a cost for these relatively infrequent examples. Post-processing
of the semantic representations could achieve the same effect.

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim eats more apples than lee eats pears"   (actual interpretation)
(DECL
 (EAT (uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1)))
  (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
  (uq
   (((more than)
     (lambda (c1)
      (EAT (uqe (some (e2) (PRES e2)))
       (name (the (x3) (and (sg x3) (named x3 LEE) (animate x3))))
       (and (pl c1) (PEAR c1)))))
    (x2) (and (pl x2) (APPLE x2))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim eats more apples than lee eats pears"   (desired interpretation)
(DECL
 (EAT (uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1)))
  (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
  (uq
   (((more than)
     (lambda (c1)
      (and (and (pl c1) (PEAR c1))
       (EAT (uqe (some (e2) (PRES e2)))
        (name (the (x3) (and (sg x3) (named x3 LEE) (animate x3)))) c1))))
    (x2) (and (pl x2) (APPLE x2))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

The other kind of [SLASH +QUA] nominal comparative, for example, {\it Kim
eats more apples than pears} is the only one whose interpretation does
not involve a proposition inside the quantifier. Here the quantifier
simply compares quantities of two entities:

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim eats more apples than pears"
(DECL
 (EAT (uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1)))
  (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
  (uq
   (((more than) (lambda (c1) (and (pl c1) (PEARS c1)))) (x2)
    (and (pl x2) (APPLES x2))))))

"more men than women drive"
(DECL
 (DRIVE (uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1)))
  (uq
   (((more than) (lambda (c1) (and (pl c1) (WOMAN c1)))) (x1)
    (and (pl x1) (MAN x1))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

\subsubsection{Semantics of Adjectival Comparatives}

The representations which translate {\it than}/{\it as} phrases in
nominal comparatives have a similar form in adjectival comparatives but
while they form part of a complex quantifier in the nominal case, they
form part of a complex degree modifier in the adjectival case.

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim is more crazy than lee is"
(DECL (BE (uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1)))
  (CRAZY (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
   (degree
    ((more than)
     (lambda (d1)
      (BE (uqe (some (e2) (PRES e2)))
       (CRAZY (name (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (named x2 LEE) (animate x2))))
        (degree d1)))))))))


"kim is more crazy than lee"
(DECL (BE (uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1)))
  (CRAZY (name (the (x1) (and (sg x1) (named x1 KIM) (animate x1))))
   (degree
    ((more than)
     (lambda (d1)
      (BE (uqe (some (e2) (NOTENSE e2)))
       (CRAZY (name (the (x2) (and (sg x2) (named x2 LEE) (animate x2))))
        (degree d1)))))))))
\end{verbatim}
\end{ex}
\normalsize

The two examples in \prevex{} have almost exactly the same translation
except that the former has tense information from the {\it is} that the
latter does not have. Following von Stechow (1984), Rayner and Banks
(1990) and many other authors we treat gradable adjectives as
relations between a subject and a degree.\footnote{When there is no
degree modifier we supply an indication of that fact: {\it crazy}
translates as {\tt (lambda (x) (CRAZY x (degree unknown)))}.} The
comparative expression becomes part of the specification of the degree
and involves a comparison of two degrees rather than two entities.

The other kinds of adjectival comparatives have the following
translations:

\small
\begin{ex}
\begin{verbatim}
"kim helps more eagerly than lee does"
(DECL (and
  (HELP #1=(uqe (some (e1) (PRES e1)))
