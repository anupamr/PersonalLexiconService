298
my Pittsburgher have become real addict to Mahler and Bruckner 

299
since he introduce so much modern music , I can not resist ask how he feel about it 

300
I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what be be write today 

301
but after all , you never learn anything else ! 

302
he cite Heine and Stendhal as favourite in literature 

303
but you want a job guarantee when you return , I continue my attack 

304
will you advise we to act the same way ? 

305
you may have fail 

306
no<blank>one want a large family or no child , and none hope for a castle or say that live in less settled circumstance will be satisfactory 

307
during his two term the constitution be test and find workable , strong national policy be inaugurate , and the tradition and power of the presidential office firmly fix 

308
principal author of the federalist , he swing New York over from opposition to the constitution to ratification almost single handedly 

309
he serve as president of the continental congress 

310
Washington never have a chance to work for an extend stretch at the occupation he love well , plantation management 

311
he serve as commander in chief during the revolution without compensation 

312
they fight hard , but they be forgiving to former foe , and seek to prevent vindictive legislature from confiscate Tory property in violation of the treaty of 1783 

313
Jay have participate in the decision that exile his old friend Van Schaack 

314
all seven recognize that independence be but the first step toward build a nation 

315
all seek the fruition of that nationalism in a federal government with substantial power 

316
indeed , the old Jeffersonian be far more atune to the Hamilton orient Whig than they be to the Jacksonian democrat 

317
long live tobacco road 

318
where be the writer to treat these change ? 

319
perhaps present writer hypnotically cling to the old order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated testing over the decade 

320
the Negro face as much , if not more , difficulty in fit himself into an urban economy as he do in an agrarian one 

321
this bold self assertion , after decade of humble subservience , be indeed a twentieth century phenomenon , an abrupt change in the southern way of existence 

322
Faulkner , for one , appear to be safe from the accuse finger of all assailant in this regard 

323
most avant-garde creator , true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement , have tend to dress their dancer in simple line and solid colour ( often black ) and to give they a bare cyclorama for a setting 

324
the depersonalization continue as the dancer be far metamorphose by the play of light upon his figure 

325
or , clothe from head to toe in fabric stretch over a series of hoop , the performer may well lose his sense of self in be a finial 

326
thus , the avant-garde choreographer have extend the scope of material available for dance composition 

327
the creator trust his intuition to lead he along a path that have internal validity because it mirror the reality of his experience 

328
the unit of form be determine subjectively : the heart , by the way of the breath , to the line 

329
he be still concern , however , with a personal event 

330
musician who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development 

331
but a toss of coin , with perhaps the add safeguard of reference to the oracle of the I Ching , the Chinese book of change , dictate the handle of the choose material 

332
accord<blank>to Katherine Litz , the become , the process of realization , be the dance 

333
this become a dance call prelude to flight 

334
Alwin Nikolais object to art as an outpouring of personal emotion 

335
the sequence of movement in a Cunningham dance be unlike any sequence to be see in life 

336
if a work be divide into several large segment , a last minute drawing of random number may determine the order of the segment for any particular performance 

337
and any sequence can not only change its position in the work but can even be eliminate from it altogether 

338
then the choreographer must arbitrate 

339
he must rearrange matter so<blank>that two performer do not bump into each other 

340
and so I will only touch upon it now ( much as I have long want to write a book about it ) 

341
this right of the state , its upholder contend , be essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralize power in the union government 

342
we begin by declare that all man be create equal 

343
the fact be that the southern confederacy differ from the early one almost as much as the federal constitution do 

344
one be tempt to say that , on the difference between the concept of sovereignty in these two preamble , the bad war of the nineteenth century be fight 

345
he issue his emancipation proclamation only when he feel that necessity leave he no other way to save the union 

346
out<blank>of this ordeal the citizen emerge , in the south as in the north , as America 's true sovereign , in a new birth of freedom , as Lincoln promise 

347
there be also a lesson , one that have serve ever since to keep American , in their conflict with one another , from turn from the ballot to the bullet 

348
one wonder about its applicability to people 

349
but it have be during the last two century , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment have make the most rapid stride 

350
be the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ? 

351
there be a haunt resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud 

352
the bomb be as harmless as an automobile in a garage 

353
the frequently postulate antique worry that the daylight hour may dwindle to complete darkness apparently give rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize 

354
it be curious that even century of repetition of the yearly cycle do not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremony of the winter solstice 

355
what element of our behaviour be decisive ? 

356
small wonder , then , that we fear 

357
the achievement which dispel our fear of the cosmos take place three century ago 

358
in agriculture , for<blank>example , despite the advance in biology , elaborate ritual tend to persist along<blank>with a continue sense of the imminence of some natural disaster 

359
there be many domain in which understanding have bring about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear 

360
perhaps the most illuminate example of the reduction of fear through understanding be derive from our increase knowledge of the nature of disease 

361
the situation with regard to our attitude and control of disease contain close analogy to problem confront we with respect to people 

362
American newspaper reviewer like to call his play nihilistic 

363
they find deep pessimism in they 

364
can it be that my own eye and ear have deceive I ? 

365
or be it relevant because it teach we something useful to know about ourselves ? 

366
when Beckett 's name come into the discussion , the priest grow loud and tell I that Beckett hate life 

367
that , I think , be at<blank>least one thing I can find out when we meet 

368
Beckett 's appearance be rough hew Irish 

369
the mouth frequently break into a disarm smile 

370
for one thing , the world that Beckett see be already shatter 

371
it be all around we and our only chance now be to let it in 

372
it be not a mess you can make sense of 

373
I be not a philosopher 

374
one can only speak of what be in<blank>front<blank>of he , and that now be simply the mess 

375
then he begin to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form 

376
but now we can keep it out no long , because we have come into a time when it invade our experience at every moment 

377
how , I ask , can chaos be admit to chaos ? 

378
that be why the form itself become a preoccupation , because it exist as a problem separate from the material it accommodate 

379
yet , I respond , can not similar thing be say about the art of the past ? 

380
this be clear 

381
this do not allow the mystery to invade we 

382
take Augustine 's doctrine of grace give and grace withhold : have you ponder the dramatic quality in this theology ? 

383
how can we make sense of this division ? 

384
the key word in my play be perhaps 

385
give a theological lead , I ask what he think about those who find a religious significance to his play 

386
he kneel down at his bed as long as he can kneel 

387
at the moment of crisis it have no more depth than an old school tie 

388
yes , for they deal with distress 

389
it be scream at you even in the taxi of London 

390
as a writer on the theatre , I have pay close attention to the play 

391
America be now join Europe in this mature phase of development 

392
man be not confine to one outlet for his vital energy 

393
the creative urge , for<blank>example , transcend the body and the self 

394
but for the beat generation all be sex 

395
jazz be sex , marijuana be a stimulus to sex , the beat tempo be adjust to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse 

396
the singular uncompromising force of their revolt against the cult of restraint be illustrate by their refusal to dance in a public place 

397
unlike the hero and flapper of the lose generation , they disdain the art of neck and pet 

398
that be reserve for the square 

399
this be far from the vulgar , leer sexuality of the middle class square in heat 

400
that be why , the argument run , the square be so fearful of jazz and yet perversely fascinate by it 

401
jazz , like sex , be a mystique 

402
the mystique of sex , combine with marijuana and jazz , be intend to provide a design for live 

403
the beatnik , secede from a society that be fatally afflict with a deathward drive , be concerned with his personal salvation in the living present 

404
their work mirror the mentality of the psychopath , rootless and irresponsible 

405
they be non-conformist on principle 

406
one beat poet compose a poem , line on a Tijuana John , which contain a<blank>few happy hint for survival 

407
the new fact the initiate of this cult have to learn be that they must move toward simplicity 

408
the professed mission of this disaffiliate generation be to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they produce be unfortunately disorder , nourish solely on the hysteria of negation 

409
who be the creative representative of this movement ? 

410
the woman who come to west Venice , have forsake radicalism , be interested in live only for the moment , in be constantly on the move 

411
other who be attract to this Mecca of the beat generation be homosexual , heroin addict , and smalltime hoodlum 

412
carry high on this charge , he compose magical poetry that capture the organic rhythm of life in word 

413
how be the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he be at the same time engage in a systematic derangement of sense 

414
after only eighteen year of non-interference , there be already indication of melioration , though in a slight degree , to be sure 

415
but with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement be impair 

416
in the pre-civil war year , the south argue that the slave be not less humanely treat than the factory worker of the north 

417
the line be a pretty good one 

418
people talk about the law of the land 

419
the expression have become quite a clich<eacute> 

420
they do not seem to be able to think of any 

421
if there be no suitable academy in your own neighbourhood , there be always new England 

422
who be involve willy nilly ? 

423
well , after everybody have follow the new England pattern of segregate one 's child into private school , only the poor folk be leave 

424
and it be precisely in this poor economic class that one find , and have always find , the most racial friction 

425
a man must be able to say , father , I have sin , or there be no hope for he 

426
it be a question which new Englander long ago put out<blank>of their mind 

427
can god be mock , ever , in the long run ? 

428
new England , as everyone know , have long be schoolmaster to the nation 

429
but I think that something more than this be involve 

430
be it not ironical that Roger Williams 's state , Rhode island , shall have be the very last of the forty eight to establish a state university ? 

431
a Yale historian , write a<blank>few year ago in the Yale review , say we in new England have long since segregate our child 

432
in one of his summer at home he marry , to the great disapproval of his father , who object because<blank>of his extreme youth 

433
he give we an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , the happy artist 

434
I scan the world through print symbol swart , and through the beggar 's rag I strive to see the inner man 

435
few writer have well understand their deep self 

436
not so , he answer , it be not the architect but the temple that be immortal 

437
almost nothing be say of Charles ' spectacular victory , the central theme be the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their idolize king in misfortune and defeat 

438
each aspire to be a god in human form , but with each it be a different kind of god 

439
each fail catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each bring ruin on the country that worship he 

440
Heidenstam write four other work of fiction about early figure revere in Swedish memory 

441
it be different with his volume the Swede and their chieftain ( Svenskarna och deras h<ouml>vdingar ) , a history intend for the general reader and particularly suit for high school student 

442
of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles XII it be unnecessary to speak 

443
note such evidence be the first step ; and almost the only cure be early detection and removal 

444
have not our physical ability already deteriorate because<blank>of the more sedentary life we be now live ? 

445
in his stead be a Milquetoast version know as the corporation 

446
no amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid fact 

447
as<blank>to benefit to employee , it be notorious for its callous disregard except where it depend on they for service 

448
in all other area , private initiative of the proprietorship type shall be urge to produce the desire good and service 

449
corporation react violently to short range stimulus , e.<blank>g. , quarterly and annual dividend report 

450
proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity , represent a human personality , and thus establish sincere relationship with customer and community 

451
leadership be lack in our society because it have no legitimate place to develop 

452
when the proprietor die , the establishment shall become a corporation until it be either acquire by another proprietor or the government decide to drop it 

453
strike threaten the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivate , prevent a healthy relationship 

454
the battle be not easy 

455
observation of the radio emission of a planet which have an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a great extent than those use short wave length and shall in some case give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristic of the solid surface 

456
radio observation of Venus and Jupiter have already supply unexpected experimental data on the physical condition of these planet 

457
Mars have be observe twice at about 3 cm wave length , and the intensity of the observe radiation be in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which may be predict on the basis of the know temperature of Mars 

458
the maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observe from the earth be about 1 minute of arc 

459
this be much small than the high resolution of even the very large reflector now under construction , and consequently the radio emission of different region of the disk can not be resolve 

460
there have be few measurement specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation 

461
in the discussion which follow , the time average of the radio emission will be refer to as the constant component , and the superimpose periodic variation will be call the variable component 

462
experiment be make on an electric arc apply a porous graphite anode cool by a transpire gas ( argon ) 

463
a detail energy balance of the anode be establish 

464
qualitative observation be make and high speed motion picture be take to study flow phenomenon in the arc at various mass flow velocity 

465
the cool requirement be particularly severe at the anode 

466
hence , the flow condition at the anode of free burning arc resemble those near a stagnation point 

467
the third method be , to our knowledge , successfully apply for the first time by C. Sheer and co-worker ( Ref. 2 ) 

468
however , technical difficulty arise by melt at local hot spot 

469
this tube can be adjust in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the require electrode space 

470
the anode in figure 2 be mount by means of the anode holder which be attach to a steel plug and disk 

471
this small pore size be require to ensure uniformity of the flow leave the anode 

472
it be expose to a high velocity gas jet 

473
in this design the anode holder be water cool and the heat loss by conduction from the anode be determine by measure the temperature rise of the coolant 

474
the power source be a commercial D. C. rectifier 

475
this region which have a high temperature than the rest of the anode surface change size and location continuously 

476
the total heat loss through the anode holder include also the heat conduct through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal part 

477
the temperature dependent value of <egr> be take from Ref. 7 

478
it consist of two block with flat surface hold apart by shim 

479
in normal use weight be hang on the end of the tape and allow to pull the tape and the material to be test between the block 

480
in this test a <formul> tape be pull between the block with a motor and pulley at a rate of <formul> with a clearance of 0.002 <Prime> on each side of the tape 

481
a system have to be use which do not depend upon the feed of the fluid into the manometer if measurement of the normal pressure be to be make in a reasonable time 

482
this negative pressure be not explain by the velocity head <formul> since this be not sufficient to explain the reading by several magnitude 

483
they also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressure 

484
<formul> be the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h 

485
the minimum total potential energy be find by take the derivative with respect to H and equate to zero 

486
this give <formul> , which be the pressure 

487
this method can be extend to include the concentration difference cause by shear field 

488
this can be justify thermodynamically in this case , and this will be do in a separate paper which be be prepare 

489
this have an interesting analogy with the assumption state by Philippoff that the deformational mechanics of elastic solid can be apply to flow solution 

490
if the mechanics be similar , we can also infer that the thermo-dynamics will also be similar 

491
if they be not ellipsoid , the conclusion will be a reasonable approximation 

492
the internal energy of an ideal gas depend on temperature only and be independent of pressure or volume 

493
note that though the ideal gas itself contain no additional energy , the compress gas do exert an increase pressure 

494
the energy for any isothermal work do by the perfect gas must come as thermal energy from its surroundings 

495
the experimental second moment <formul> conform to the relation <formul> in agreement with theory 

496
the paramagnetic dipole effect provide some information on the particle shape 

497
we first discuss the <formul> bond in <formul> 

498
there be ample evidence from many source that the <formul> bond in <formul> be symmetric 

499
here the <formul> distance be 2.44 A 

500
there be , then , the possibility that this <formul> bond be symmetric , although Douglass be unable to determine its symmetry from his x ray data
