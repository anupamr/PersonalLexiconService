^ One analyst, noting that most such machines are about two inches thick, takes exception to the name.

^ And 10 minutes after the UAL trading halt came news that the UAL group couldn't get financing for its bid.
^ At Quantum , which is based in New York , the trouble is magnified by the company's heavy dependence on plastics.
^ Quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin, used to make garbage bags, milk jugs, housewares, toys and meat packaging, among other items.
^ Benchmark grades, which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring, have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents.
^ Meanwhile, the price of ethylene, the chemical building block of polyethylene, hasn't dropped nearly so fast.

^ For the first time, the 83-year-old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent, rather than as a force in the high court's majority.
^ This role reversal holds true, as well, for his three liberal and moderate allies, Justices Thurgood Marshall , Harry Blackmun and John Stevens .
^ The four justices are no newcomers to dissent, often joining forces in the past decade to criticize the court's conservative drift.
^ Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a ``generation-skipping'' flavor to current dissents.
^ ``Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future,'' he says.

Altman & Co., as well as majority positions in Merksamer Jewelers, a Sacramento chain; Sakowitz Inc., the Houston-based retailer, and Parisian Inc., the Southeast department-store chain.
^ September's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists, and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market's plunge Friday.
^ After falling for three consecutive months, the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9% last month, the Labor Department reported Friday, as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer.
^ Although the report, which was released before the stock market opened, didn't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts said it did play a role in the market's decline.

^ CenTrust , however, touts the branch sale, saying it would bring in $150 million and reduce the thrift's assets to $6.7 billion from $9 billion.
^ Mr. Paul counters  that he intends to further pare  the size of CenTrust by not renewing  more than $1 billion of brokered certificates of deposit when they come due.

^ In the year-earlier third quarter, when the industry was in the midst of a boom, the company had net of $61 million, or $1.7 a share, on sales of $1.02 billion.

^ As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt, live television and the nightclub circuit, Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular.
^ If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers , would the water be quite so hot?
^ And it has remained there, as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called ``Bridget Loves Bernie '', whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney .
^ For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker.
^ The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end (and occasionally in the middle) .
^ But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about ``caring for other people'' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America.
^ But Senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside, including a capital-gains tax cut.
^ White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters yesterday that the administration wouldn't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill.
^ And a senior aide to the House Ways and Means Committee , where tax legislation originates, said there aren't any ``plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year.''
^ To the delight of some doctors, the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare .

^ I disagree with the statement by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in congressional hearings.
^ ``We view Friday's market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors,'' a recording at Gabelli & Co. funds said over the weekend.
^ Thus, when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding, particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel, one must conclude that he held a good-faith, justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.
^ The subcommittee, Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime.
^ Another study found that  the 82 Fridays the 13th in the 1940-1987 period had higher than average returns -- higher even than Fridays in general, which tend to be strong days for stock prices.

^ Two years ago, faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories, market makers themselves began dumping shares, exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices.

^ Joseph Hardiman , president of the National Association of Securities Dealers , which oversees the Nasdaq computerized trading system, said that despite the rush of selling, he never considered the situation an ``emergency.''
^ More troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of small-investor support the OTC market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the October 1987 crash.
^ The sellers on Friday came from all corners of the OTC market -- big and small institutional investors, as well as individual investors and market makers.
^ But  grateful traders said the sell orders generally ranged from 20,000 shares to 50,000 shares, compared with blocks of 500,000 shares or more two years ago.

^ ``Last time, we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst,'' said John W. Rogers, president of Chicago-based Ariel Capital Management Inc., which manages $1.1 billion of stocks.
^ Most often, they do just that, because stocks have proved to be the best-performing long-term investment, attracting about $1 trillion from pension funds alone.
^ ``If you bought after the crash, you did very very well off the bottom,'' said Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc. .

^ And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines , which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC .
^ The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit, resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $76 billion, even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $12 billion during that period.
^ Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation.
^ When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation, Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , hailed it.
^ The White House Office of Management and Budget, whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met, estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $6.2 billion, almost half of the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of $11.0 billion.
