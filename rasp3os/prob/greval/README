gold700files.rasp is our version of the Parc 700 dependency bank with
RASP GRs from tsg15 added either manually or interactively

sents-ne.* JAC's run and test data (now edited by me for quotes)

check-parc.lsp|fasl checks our GRs against Parc's and highlights
differences, etc -- see comp-rels.txt for current output

runeval.sh runs a trained parser on the Parc (NE) sentences

creat non-NE version of sents-ne-tst.txt by removing <w> </w> tags

gramreleval-new(-noquotes).lsp evaluates results v. gold standard

park700/

gold560)ne).rasp is the gold standard for the 560 sentences used by
Parc in their NAACL04 paper

(the latter include balanced quotes, marked up as (ta quote link|ellip
word|head) -- remove these from eval if not using latest version of tsg15)

test files for above with ne and pos mark up

NEW EVALUATION CODE: 

applies code in gramreleval-new-scheme.lsp

use eval.sh as outlined in $RASP/manuals/eval/eval-report.pdf

example usage of the main script eval.sh:

./eval.sh -d -t example -e'-u -o -s n -g s -m'

eval.sh processes the rasp output file example.out and creates the
files example.(trans.)parses and example.(trans.)grtext. These files are
then processed by the eval_system.sh script which is invoked within
the eval.sh script.

If users wish to evaluate given OTHER parser output they can create
their own intermediate file formats (.parses and .grtext see the
report pdf) and invoke the evaluation system directly.

./eval_system.sh -t example.trans -c sents-tst.gr -u -o -s n -g s -m
